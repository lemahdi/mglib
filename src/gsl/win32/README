This is a port of GSL 1.13 to Visual Studio C++ 2008 Express Edition

I maintain this port because I had problems with the debug
informations of the cygwin binaries distribution. .NET 2003 was
unable to debug code linked against these cygwin libraries.

Contact me if you need the library in other forms (at the moment,
only static library with multithread DLL is provided)

Settings you have to change when creating your own project :
- additional include directory should point to gsl\include
- additional library directory should point to gsl\lib
- Code generation : use /MDd for Debug and /MD for Release
- Debug config should link with "cblas_d.lib gsl_d.lib"
- Release config should link with "cblas.lib gsl.lib"

(If you need versions compiled with /MTd and /MT, use the source
package and recompile the "Debug MT" and "Release MT" configurations)

The binary distribution contains an example project to show how to
use this library with Visual Studio 2008 Express Edition. Just load
example\example.sln into visual studio, compile and run.
