    //! Struct to protect critical sections.
    /*!
    This struct is specifically intended to protect unthreadsafe code which may
    be encountered during execution of a worksheet formula that has been
    registered with Excel as threadsafe ($).

    To protect a critical section, enclose it in a scope - e.g. a function
    scope, local scope, etc.  At the beginning of the scope, declare a variable
    of type XlfMutex on the stack.
    \code
    {                               // Begin scope
        XlfMutex xlfMutex;          // Acquire lock
        ...                         // Critical section (unthreadsafe code)
    }                               // End scope, lock released by ~XlfMutex()
    \endcode
    */

    struct XlfMutex {
        HANDLE hMutex;
        XlfMutex() {
            //hMutex = CreateMutex(NULL, FALSE, "xlw_mutex");
            hMutex = CreateMutex(NULL, FALSE, _T("xlw_mutex"));
            WaitForSingleObject(hMutex, INFINITE);
        }
        ~XlfMutex() {
            ReleaseMutex(hMutex);
            CloseHandle(hMutex);
        }
    };

}
